## Project Overview

This project is a functional clone of Discord, the popular communication platform. It implements core features of Discord such as real-time messaging, user authentication, channel creation, and user profiles. The application provides a familiar interface for users to communicate through text channels.

## Technology Stack

The application is built with the following technologies:

- **Frontend Framework**: React.js - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **State Management**: Redux (with Redux Toolkit) - For centralized application state management
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript - Providing static typing to JavaScript
- **Authentication & Database**: Firebase - Cloud services for authentication and data storage
- **UI Framework**: Material UI - Component library with pre-designed elements
- **Styling**: SCSS - Enhanced CSS with variables and nesting
- **Build Tool**: Create React App - Setup and configuration for React applications

## Project Structure

The repository has the following structure:

```

## Key Features

The application includes the following key features:

1. **User Authentication**: Login with Google account via Firebase Authentication
2. **Channels**: Create and join text channels for communication
3. **Real-time Messaging**: Send and receive messages in real-time
4. **User Interface**: Discord-like UI with sidebar and chat area
5. **User Profiles**: Display user information and profile pictures

## Component Architecture

The application follows a component-based architecture:

### Main Components:

- **App**: Root component that manages authentication state and renders the main UI
- **Login**: Handles user authentication with Firebase
- **Sidebar**: Shows channels and user information
- **Chat**: Displays messages and input for a selected channel
- **ChatHeader**: Shows the current channel information
- **Message**: Renders individual message content
- **SidebarChannel**: Represents a channel in the sidebar

## State Management

Redux is used for state management with two main slices:

1. **userSlice**: Manages user authentication state
   - Tracks current user information
   - Handles login/logout actions

2. **appSlice**: Manages application state
   - Tracks current channel information
   - Handles channel selection

## Authentication

The application uses Firebase Authentication:

- Google sign-in provider for authentication
- Authentication state persists across sessions
- User data (display name, profile picture, email) is stored in Redux

## Database Structure

Firebase Firestore is used as the database with the following structure:

- **channels**: Collection of available text channels
  - Each document represents a channel with properties like name and timestamp
  - Contains a subcollection of messages

- **messages**: Subcollection within each channel document
  - Each document represents a message with sender information, content, and timestamp

## Setup Instructions

To set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
4. The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

## Development Workflow

To contribute to the project:

1. Create a new branch for your feature
2. Make changes and test locally
3. Commit and push changes to your branch
4. Create a pull request for code review
5. After approval, merge your changes into the main branch

## Firebase Configuration

The application uses Firebase for authentication and database. The configuration is stored in `src/firebase.ts`. For security reasons, you may want to set up your own Firebase project and replace the configuration values.

## Styling

The application uses SCSS for styling with separate files for each component. The styling follows a modular approach, with component-specific styles scoped to their respective components.

## Error Handling

The application includes error boundaries to catch and handle errors gracefully, presenting user-friendly error messages rather than crashing the application.
